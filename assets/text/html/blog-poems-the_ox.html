<h1>No Cunning Fox, Nor Ancient Croc</h1>
<p>Terraforms, Ferries Rocks,<br />
Burduned Labor, Guardian's Favor,<br />
Humble Repast, Heavy Contrast,<br />
Behold the Mighty Ox!  </p>
<p>Like a Mast, Strong and Fast,<br />
Can Hold a Pair, While Still Laid Bare,<br />
No Need to Seek, Valor is Peak,<br />
The Day He Can Outlast!  </p>
<p>Does not Speak, Though Some Shriek,<br />
A Patient Stare, a Slow Hand's Care,<br />
Will Scatter Hawks, and Level Blocks,<br />
The Earth goes to the Meek!  </p>
<p>Stoic Walks, As Earth Tocks,<br />
Silent Prayer, Goblin Slayer,<br />
As with the Past, and Everlast,<br />
Hail to the Noble Ox!  </p>
