   Traveler's Ode
  </h1>
  <p>
   In solitude, he walks miles eight,
  </p>
  <p>
   A boy endowed with slender frame,
  </p>
  <p>
   Though heavy burdened, fasting late,
  </p>
  <p>
   He marches on with boots of shame.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hidden within his tattered sack
  </p>
  <p>
   Are seeds of grain, to hone, to plant,
  </p>
  <p>
   The answers to his stomach’s lack,
  </p>
  <p>
   The keys to hope filling his hands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each step a struggle, weary, worn,
  </p>
  <p>
   Through jagged paths, he limps and bleeds.
  </p>
  <p>
   Harsh winds declare his cloak is torn,
  </p>
  <p>
   He must bring home his precious beads.
  </p>
  <p>
   He looks ahead and sees a church,
  </p>
  <p>
   A harsh reminder, there’s still five.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pained and doubting his wayward lurch,
  </p>
  <p>
   His heart whispers, "Will I survive?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Full exhaustion, broken spirit,
  </p>
  <p>
   He crawled into the chapel’s door.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bruised and beaten, seeking respite,
  </p>
  <p>
   He wonders what his life is for.
  </p>
  <p>
   He mourns the battery he heeds,
  </p>
  <p>
   His life, so woven with sorrow.
  </p>
  <p>
   All to bring home some simple seeds,
  </p>
  <p>
   Whose reward are years to follow.
  </p>
  <p>
   Suddenly, his heart rejoices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Soul restored by future’s fam’ly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meek and humble, powered forces,
  </p>
  <p>
   Weathering all calamity.
  </p>
  <p>
   He stands, collects his meager pouch.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though body bruised, his heart aflame,
  </p>
  <p>
   The storms of life, ready to couch,
  </p>
  <p>
   The church he departs, not the same.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though far must he go, winds still whip,
  </p>
  <p>
   And path is filled with pointed stone,
  </p>
  <p>
   A seed of hope blooms on his trip.
  </p>
  <p>
   In solitude, he’s not alone.
