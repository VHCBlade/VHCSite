<h1>Traveler's Ode</h1>
<p>In solitude, he walks miles eight,<br />
A boy endowed with slender frame,<br />
Though heavy burdened, fasting late,<br />
He marches on with boots of shame.  </p>
<p>Hidden within his tattered sack<br />
Are seeds of grain, to hone, to plant,<br />
The answers to his stomach's lack,<br />
The keys to hope filling his hands.  </p>
<p>Each step a struggle, weary, worn,<br />
Through jagged paths, he limps and bleeds.<br />
Harsh winds declare his cloak is torn,<br />
He must bring home his precious beads.  </p>
<p>He looks ahead and sees a church,<br />
A harsh reminder, there's still five.<br />
Pained and doubting his wayward lurch,<br />
His heart whispers, "Will I survive?"  </p>
<p>Full exhaustion, broken spirit,<br />
He crawled into the chapel's door.<br />
Bruised and beaten, seeking respite,<br />
He wonders what his life is for.  </p>
<p>He mourns the battery he heeds,<br />
His life, so woven with sorrow.<br />
All to bring home some simple seeds,<br />
Whose reward are years to follow.  </p>
<p>Suddenly, his heart rejoices.<br />
Soul restored by future's fam'ly.<br />
Meek and humble, powered forces,<br />
Weathering all calamity.  </p>
<p>He stands, collects his meager pouch.<br />
Though body bruised, his heart aflame,<br />
The storms of life, ready to couch,<br />
The church he departs, not the same.  </p>
<p>Though far must he go, winds still whip,<br />
And path is filled with pointed stone,<br />
A seed of hope blooms on his trip.<br />
In solitude, he's not alone.  </p>
