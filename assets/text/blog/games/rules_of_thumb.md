When I’m trying to help people improve at League of Legends, I’ll often tell them to follow certain rules of thumb. Prioritize farming over fighting, retreat toward your base, hit whoever is closest in a teamfight. However, this will sometimes be met with resistance. I’ll hear about situations where the rules of thumb are inappropriate, or even that they don’t want to suppress their gameplay by following these oppressive rules. While there is merit to these objections, rules of thumb still have a great utility that should be used, especially by beginners to a game.

# Freedom through Limitation

While it might seem counter-intuitive, rules of thumb actually give you more freedom in how you play your game. Consider a novice League of Legends player who is presented with various decisions during a match: Should he push for objectives, engage in team fights, or split-push to apply map pressure? By the time he chooses, his nexus could already be exploding! Analysis Paralysis would have taken yet another victim. 

By adhering to simple rules of thumb, the amount of choices he can make would be limited, allowing him room for exploration without being completely overwhelmed. Moreover, the decisions that he would be making would be more meaningful, allowing him to cultivate his own playstyle. And so the rules of thumb have given the player meaningful choices, rather than being lost in a sea of indecision.

# Walk Before You Run

Before you start shredding tunes on a guitar, you first need to learn how to play the chords, as well as how to strum. There would be no merit in trying and failing to play the hardest songs without first mastering the basics. In a video game however, we still need to play the entire game. We can’t just time out with our opponents and tell them that we only want to play a specific part of the game! 

Rules of Thumb, however, serve as a great hack for simplifying the game. By using them, we can focus on learning the fundamentals of the game. Overtime, we can learn the cause-and-effect of our actions and slowly rely on the rules of thumb less and less. By learning to walk with the assistance of these guidelines, we can more effectively run without them as we master the game.

# The Tilt Realigner

Some games will just put us in a sour mood. We’ve died 5 times in 10 minutes, we just can’t hit any of our CS, our teammates are pinging us to “bait” every 5 seconds. Times like these will flare our emotions and cloud our judgment. Enter the "Tilt Realigner": rules of thumb serve as the perfect remedy to realign our focus and regain composure during these frustrating moments.

When the pressure is on and emotions run high, following rules of thumb becomes even more critical. Instead of succumbing to tilt and making rash decisions, players can rely on the guidelines to regain their footing. While these rules might not always lead to the best outcome, they will at least be good decisions that prevent us from falling further into despair. By shielding us from our worst impulses, these rules of thumb can give us the best opportunity to win!

# The Invisible Hand

In conclusion, rules of thumb are a valuable tool in any video game. They provide players with a sense of freedom through limitation, guiding decision-making and preventing analysis paralysis. By adhering to these simple guidelines, players can focus on learning the fundamentals of the game and gradually develop their own playstyle. Furthermore, rules of thumb act as a valuable tilt realigner, helping players regain composure during frustrating moments and preventing them from making impulsive and detrimental decisions.

Rather than inhibiting your play, rules of thumb can enhance it. While you don’t have to always follow them, it’s nice to always have these rules of thumb at hand.
