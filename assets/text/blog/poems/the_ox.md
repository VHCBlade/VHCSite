Terraforms, Ferries Rocks,  
Burduned Labor, Guardian's Favor,  
Humble Repast, Heavy Contrast,  
Behold the Mighty Ox!  

Like a Mast, Strong and Fast,  
Can Hold a Pair, While Still Laid Bare,  
No Need to Seek, Valor is Peak,  
The Day He Can Outlast!  

Does not Speak, Though Some Shriek,  
A Patient Stare, a Slow Hand's Care,  
Will Scatter Hawks, and Level Blocks,  
The Earth goes to the Meek!  

Stoic Walks, As Earth Tocks,  
Silent Prayer, Goblin Slayer,  
As with the Past, and Everlast,  
Hail to the Noble Ox!
