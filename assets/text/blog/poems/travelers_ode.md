In solitude, he walks miles eight,  
A boy endowed with slender frame,  
Though heavy burdened, fasting late,  
He marches on with boots of shame.  

Hidden within his tattered sack  
Are seeds of grain, to hone, to plant,  
The answers to his stomach’s lack,  
The keys to hope filling his hands.  

Each step a struggle, weary, worn,  
Through jagged paths, he limps and bleeds.  
Harsh winds declare his cloak is torn,  
He must bring home his precious beads.  

He looks ahead and sees a church,  
A harsh reminder, there’s still five.  
Pained and doubting his wayward lurch,  
His heart whispers, "Will I survive?"  

Full exhaustion, broken spirit,  
He crawled into the chapel’s door.  
Bruised and beaten, seeking respite,  
He wonders what his life is for.  

He mourns the battery he heeds,  
His life, so woven with sorrow.  
All to bring home some simple seeds,  
Whose reward are years to follow.  

Suddenly, his heart rejoices.  
Soul restored by future’s fam’ly.  
Meek and humble, powered forces,  
Weathering all calamity.  

He stands, collects his meager pouch.  
Though body bruised, his heart aflame,  
The storms of life, ready to couch,  
The church he departs, not the same.  

Though far must he go, winds still whip,  
And path is filled with pointed stone,  
A seed of hope blooms on his trip.  
In solitude, he’s not alone.
