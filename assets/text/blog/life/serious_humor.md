# Serious Beginnings
--------------------

I’ve always been a serious person. Growing up, my mother noted how different my style of play was with cars compared to other kids. While my younger brother would zoom them around the place and crash them into each other, I would simply line them up. If anybody disturbed the careful organization, I would glare at them, before promptly putting the car back into its “proper” place. 

This didn’t change as I grew up. I would spend my free time in school doing Math equations because I found it fun. I would always try to deepen conversations I had by talking about values and morality. I even took my [video games](https://vhcblade.com/#/blog/games/git_gud) very seriously and always tried to be as good as I could possibly be given the time I spent playing. This trait of mine came with its ups and downs, as with any trait one could have. However the biggest downside was that I never really understood humor.

# Pass on Pariah
----------------

The human being is a social creature. This is a phrase that my mother kept repeating to me as I grew up. Usually this would be in response to me saying that I didn’t really need to socialize. It took a long time, but eventually I understood what this meant. In this world, a single human being can barely make a difference on their own. Consider the man alone in the wilderness; every second used to simply ensure that he continues existing. It is only through the help of others that we are able to focus on improving life.

And if socialization is so central to human life, what’s the best way to connect with other people? Well, it turns out that laughing with each other is one of the best ways to connect. A hearty laugh can melt away our barriers and quickly foster a sense of camaraderie. In contrast, people that can’t take a joke seem strange. What could be hiding beneath their unflinching veneer? Humor can change how we are perceived from a pariah to a comrade very quickly.

# Only a Flesh Wound
--------------------

Back in High School, I remember that I had a really bad day once. Nothing seemed to go my way, and I started being rather pessimistic. My best friend saw that I was down in the dumps and asked what was wrong. I told him that I’ve had a really disappointing day and I just wish that I wasn’t so sad. “Then stop being sad!” he told me confidently. The suggestion caught me so off-guard that I couldn’t help laughing. Suddenly, my day didn’t seem so bad anymore and my mood lifted.

Humor at its best can strengthen our fortitude and help us face the challenges we have ahead. It can help reframe the despair we feel and help us find solutions to the problems we face. While there’s nothing wrong with being tense in tough situations, a taut bow will wear out faster. Humor can help us unwind and replenish our strength.

# A Cut from Hanlon
-------------------

Think about the adjectives that we often use to describe someone that is very witty. They can be quick, sharp, or clever. It’s no coincidence that these are also words we’d use to describe someone that was smart. To engage in humor constantly requires us to exercise our intelligence to quickly come up with humorous replies. The mental agility to constantly engage in banter is impressive and can easily be used for other ends.

Humor requires an appreciation for linguistic subtleties and parallel thinking. Not only that, but we need to find a way to phrase it so that other people will find the wonder in what we see. 

# Laughing Lesson
-----------------

As I reflect on my own journey from a serious and humorless person to one who now cherishes laughter, I have come to realize the immense benefits of humor in our daily lives: Humor has allowed me to approach social situations with ease, breaking down barriers and fostering a sense of belonging. Humor grants us the ability to find light in darkness, easing our minds and providing the strength to face even the toughest of battles. humor has not only sharpened my wit but also expanded my cognitive horizons.

More than just tolerating humor, a serious person should see it as a necessary and fitting tool for life. I implore all my fellow serious people to embrace the humor in your life. For even if you are serious, you don’t have to take yourself so seriously.
