# Wisdom of the Ages
--------------------

Growing up, my brother and I would often poke fun at our parents' ability to speak English. They had specifically raised us to speak the language well since they felt that it was important for thriving in life. Thanks to their effort, we have a mastery of the language that my parents could only dream of. I'll often reflexively repeat a word my father mispronounced. Typically, he'll simply brush this off and we'll have a good laugh about it. My parents will often brag about how they made children that were smarter and even better people than they are themselves.

And yet time and time again, my mother will say something that just floors me. My father will impart some knowledge that just completely eludes me. And I am once again reminded that there is still an ocean of wisdom they can give me. The path I am carefully exploring is one that is already familiar to my parents. After all, they have more than twice the life experiences I do (Even more when you consider that school shouldn't really count Hahahaha). Wisdom that can only come with age is bequeath to me by the lips of my parents.

And I find myself once again humbled. And it is only through this humilty that I am able accept the bequest of wisdom. Had I chosen to believe only in myself, I would have refused this gift; simply stumbling through unseen shocks because of my solitary psyche.

# Buried by Vainglory
---------------------------

"Fake it 'til you make it" is a common refrain nowadays. This saying seems to me to be very prideful, and only prophesy destruction. I could 'fake' being wiser than my parents, however this would rob me from benefitting from their real wisdom. After all, why would someone wiser listen to the unwise? It is only through recongnizing my lack of wisdom that I am able to become wiser. Conversely, deceiving myself into believing that I am wiser than I am prevents me from ever becoming as wise as I could be.

Vainglory is not just unprofitable, it prevents profit all together. A Chess player who believes himself to be the best intrinsically would have no reason to practice. A software developer who believes his knowledge sufficient will quickly be left behind by the progress of technology. Vainglory binds us to our current state. A paralytic poison that is common and can only be cured in one way. The antidote to vainglory, is humility.

# Transformation through Temperance
-----------------------------------

Through humility, we are able to shed our pride and see ourselves as we truly are. We can see the things that we are truly good at, as well as all the things that we can improve. It is only through humility that we are able to be prudent in our decisions. With renewed vision, we are able to embrace the grace that others offer us. And through accepting their grace, we may also be able to accept their hand in friendship. And through the support of those that want the best for us, we will be able to have the confidence to forge on into the unknown.

Humility transforms us into a sponge, absorbing the good that those around us has to offer. We become a person more accepting of others faults because of our knowledge of our own faults. We become a child once again, brimming with potential to grow. We become an empty vessel, ready to be filled and overflow.

# Grace of God
--------------

In conclusion, the utility of humility cannot be overstated. While it might not be held as a virtue as often in popular culture, it is still the only path to attaining true wisdom. The world is a vast and grand place, full of mysteries that we can't possibly hope to unravel ourselves within our lifetime. In light of this fact, we should not despair or be filled with hubris. We should instead approach it with humility, ready to accept what we can hold from it.
