# About Me

Hello there! I'm your resident Generation Z Security/Software Engineer that is into Philosophy and Psychology and dabbles a little in music. Or put in a non-pretentious way, I'm a script kiddie that codes and likes hearing his own voice. I also like Skateboarding but I'm way too bad at it to brag about it. Mabuhay ang Pilipinas!

I'm an independent Software Developer based in the Philippines. I specialize in making apps and websites, and I've deployed a number of web servers in my time as well. If you want to hire me or ask about a project, you can send your inquiry at <inquiry@vhcblade.com>. If you want to see some of my work, click on the apps tab which will bring you to [some of the apps I've made](https://vhcblade.com/#/apps). You can also view the source code of some of the projects I made at my [GitHub](https://github.com/VHCBlade).

# The Logo

[Logo Maker - Niblitz!](https://www.instagram.com/art_niblitz/)

Special thanks to my highschool classmate Niblitz for creating my logo. I got him to make it back when I was first starting out and I just absolutely fell in love with the logo he made. I put it on some shirts that I wear around and it's featured prominently in this very website!

# The Code

The code of this website is made open source. I wanted to make a good example website that new Flutter developers can just take advantage of. While I don't claim to be some kind of Flutter guru, I think that seeing a project with some amount of complexity is generally helpful.

Also because I myself have benefitted from open source projects, I want others to potentially benefit me as well. The freer the code the freer the people!
