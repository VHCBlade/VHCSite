# Sanctification through Suffering

***“Do you suffer when you code?”***

The question caught me off guard. I had arranged this meeting with an old friend with the intention to celebrate the good fortune that we had both found ourselves in. As I sat across from him, I realized that he had brought forth a profoundly philosophical inquiry that extended beyond the realm of programming. This of course was the last thing I expected.

***“Do you suffer when you code?”***

He repeats the question. He can probably see the shock in my face upon hearing the question. I hastily formulate a response so as to not deaden the conversation.

“Well, I like to think that I don’t.” I began, attempting to explain my relationship with coding. “Although at some point I had doubts as to whether this was the right career for me, it is now something that I thoroughly enjoy. I love solving problems through code and continually evolving my design skills and philosophy.”

My response, though genuine, seemed to miss the heart of his question. I mustered a weak grin as I looked back at him for his response. His enigmatic smile reveals that he has something profound to say. He opens his lips and says,

***“Coding is only meaningful if you suffer for it.”***

# The Suffering Artist
-------------------

I have long pondered the inescapable nature of suffering. It’s something that we are subjected to whether we acknowledge it or not. To live is to experience the pangs of hunger, or the [melancholy](https://vhcblade.com/#/blog/life/interrupted_metamorphosis) of loneliness. When we suffer, it demands our attention – sucking the joy out of our lives when it becomes too great. And yet, suffering is often associated with great beauty and meaning.

It’s a common trope that artists often create their best work in the midst of their greatest suffering. It’s so common in fact that it is often parodied with depictions of great cooks or painters willingly throwing themselves in harm’s way in search of their muse. Suffering, rather than distracting with its presence, becomes the source for the storyteller's themes. 

# The Trials of a Hero
-------------------

We see this theme of suffering not just through the artist, but in the art itself. Stories must first put their heroes through great perils before they emerge victorious in the end. Nemo must first be lost before he is found, and once found, must be lost again, and again, before being reunited with Marlin at last. Luke Skywalker must lose his hand to Darth Vader before finally bringing him back to the light. Jesus Christ must first go through his passion and die before being resurrected and ascending into heaven.

It is clear to us that the suffering that the hero goes through is vital to these stories. In fact, without the struggle, there would be no story at all. Nobody wants to watch “Marlin takes Nemo to School” or “Star Peace.” The conflict that the hero faces is what makes the stories interesting. It is the hero's willingness to confront and endure suffering that captures our imagination – their pursuit of what is valuable, whether it be their son, their father, or the entire human race.

# Sanctifying Grace
-------------------

Drawing threads from the worlds of art and storytelling, we arrive at the concept of sanctification through suffering. The idea that enduring hardship can elevate our pursuits to a higher plane of meaning and purpose resonates deeply with the human experience. Ultimately, we are compelled to view our struggles not as mere obstacles, but as opportunities for elevation. Everything that is worth anything is worth sacrificing for. It is precisely in that sacrifice where we draw our meaning.

***“Coding is only meaningful if you suffer for it.”***

His words pierced straight into the very depths of my soul. In that simple sentence, he had captured a deep truth about the world we live in. Upon this realization, my soul leaped for joy at the freedom attained from learning of this truth.

But what is more, I was reminded of the great suffering that my old friend had faced himself. Of all the trials he had once faced because of his career. I could see that he not did not resent the suffering he had gone through. Moreover, it seemed to be something from which he drew strength. I was in awe at the maturity that my friend had shown, and I felt grateful that he imparted this wisdom into me.

***“Yeah, I guess it is.”***
