# "Git Gud" and why you should (maybe)

I am a very serious gamer. I peaked at Diamond 1 (top 1%) in League of Legends and even hit Challenger (top 200) in Teamfight Tactics. This should bring up different thoughts, such as “Get a Life” or “What a loser,” or perhaps you might find it mildly impressive. Either way, you’ll recognize that I needed to dedicate some time to specifically get better at these games. I’ll be making the case that playing to improve like I did was a good use of my time.

# The Will to Improve
---------------------

If you play to get better, you’ll start to realize just how bad you are. You’ll realize that your reflexes aren’t as fast as you’d like. You’ll find yourself confused at different game states. You’ll see just how much better others are at you at the game. Seeing the mountain you must climb can be discouraging. The path to “gud”ness appears before us as rough and harrowing. Not only that, but we have our stagnant rank as proof of our failures. And it is precisely this difficulty why we must pursue it.

For everything in life that is meaningful demands that we strive for it. While the reward for competence in video games are meager, the attaining of this competence fosters a spirit of industriousness and excellence. Pushing through the adversity of one’s own limitations is a universal and lifelong experience. Becoming as good as you can at anything will make you better at being the best you can at anything. Even if it’s just ranking up to the next level.

It is no coincidence that [Rise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB8TyLTD7EE) is widely regarded as the best Worlds song. Foster that spirit and RISE in your pursuits in life.

# Hobby vs Pastime
------------------

When you actively try to get better at the games you’re playing, it transforms your pastime into a hobby. It’s no secret that most gamers spend upwards of 5 hours on video games daily. Something that requires that much time deserves to be more than just a pastime. If we spend too much time simply trying to pass it, we’ll miss the meaning that our life can hold! Even worse, when something is this easy, it could potentially get us hooked and prevent us from doing the things in our life that truly matter.

On the other hand, a hobby can uplift us and increase our humanity. Fostering a skill that has no inherent monetary value reflects our nature as having BOTH body and soul. While there are so many things that demand our attention, we still give it to this thing that we ourselves seek out. Rather than potentially corrupting our soul, video games can instead nourish and replenish it.

# An Opportunity for Leadership
-------------------------------

As we become better at the video games we play, it creates in us a skill that others might also want to attain. This presents to us an opportunity to teach those that may wish to improve their own skills. Should we decide to help our friends or try to teach them, we practice an aspect of leadership. And through this, we can become better from the successes and failures we experience.

This is even more true if we play a team-based competitive game. I’ve personally learned quite a bit from playing League of Legends with my friends. I’ve learned that I need to meet my friends where they are, while still being able to band together to attain the win (or at least have a good time). By fostering this skill, we can then learn how to bring people to where we already are. 

# The Casual Case
-----------------

Now does everybody need to take their video games seriously? As much as it pains me to say, the answer is no. After all, plenty of people play video games merely to act as an escape. And while doing so for an extended period of time will lead to ruin, one can easily engage in this escapism for a healthy amount of time. Not everybody will take the game as seriously, and that’s OK.

Casuals can instead share in the culture of playing the same game. Video games can instead be a social lubricant that helps mediate our relationships with each other.

# To Sweat or not to Sweat
--------------------------

In conclusion, the pursuit of improvement in gaming can be a valuable and meaningful endeavor. The will to improve pushes us to confront our limitations, overcome challenges, and strive for excellence. It fosters a spirit of industriousness and resilience that transcends the virtual world and applies to various aspects of life. Gaming, when approached with dedication and a desire to get better, transforms from a mere pastime into a fulfilling hobby that uplifts and nourishes our souls. Furthermore, the journey of improvement in gaming can provide opportunities for leadership, teaching, and collaboration within a team-based environment. 

While not everybody will choose to walk this path, it is a road that is worth traveling. I hope that you consider this the next time you play a game. To Sweat or not to Sweat.
