# VHCSite

This is the GitHub for my statically hosted site [vhcblade.com](vhcblade.com) I made this open source so that anyone can just take it and use it for their own projects. Powered by Flutter.

This project also serves as a demonstration for the various event-based packages I've developed for Flutter, as well as Dart in general.

# Packages Used

- [event_bloc](github.com/VHCBlade/event_bloc) - an event-based implementation of the BLoC pattern.
- [event_db](github.com/VHCBlade/event_db) - A companion package for handling serializable models and databases with event_bloc.
