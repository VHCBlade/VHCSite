# About Me

Hello there! I'm your resident Generation Z Security/Software Engineer that is into Philosophy and Psychology and dabbles a little in music. Or put in a non-pretentious way, I'm a script kiddie that codes and likes hearing his own voice. I also like Skateboarding but I'm way too bad at it to brag about it. Mabuhay ang Pilipinas!

I started making YouTube videos because I wanted a reason to write. And since I already had the essays of my ideas, it just seemed natural to start turning them into YouTube videos. Creating this website is just another extension of the exact same idea. I've also made this entire website open source so that if some other developer wants to make their own website, they can use this as a springboard.

# The Logo

Special thanks to my highschool classmate Niblitz for creating my logo. I got him to make it back when I was first starting out and I just absolutely fell in love with the logo he made. I put it on some shirts that I wear around and it's featured prominently in this very website!

# The Code

The code of this website is made open source. I wanted to make a good example website that new Flutter developers can just take advantage of. While I don't claim to be some kind of Flutter guru, I think that seeing a project with some amount of complexity is generally helpful.

Also because I myself have benefitted from open source projects, I want others to potentially benefit me as well. The freer the code the freer the people!
