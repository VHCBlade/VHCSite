# Infectious Disease
--------------------

Picture this: a bitter, resentful man sitting at home brooding over how awful his day was. 

His boss had shouted at him at work… He got stuck in a traffic jam on his way home… He had looked forward to taking the edge off with a glass of milk, only to open the refrigerator to an almost empty carton. He wonders where it all went wrong, wallowing in his misery. A few hours later, his wife gets home after spending a night out with her friends. She excitedly tells her husband that one of her friends had won the lottery. “Good for her,” the man says sarcastically, as he sinks even further into despair.

Think about it, would you want to be around this man? A person so focused on their own misery that they ignore the good news of other people. Or even worse, hearing about others’ good fortune makes them even more miserable. Is that someone you want to be your family member, lover, or friend? Is that someone that you would want to share good things with? Or perhaps you’re actually the one that others avoid telling good news, hiding their joy and excitement from you. People tiptoeing around you, afraid to be infected with your gloom.

# Problems with Altruism
------------------------

It seems obvious to us that this man should change. It’s hard to imagine that this person would be a lot of fun to be around. Perhaps his presence creates a feeling of dread whenever something good happens, hoping that he doesn’t find out. Walking on eggshells when sharing any good news has to be exhausting. It is clear that his companions would prefer that he be happy for their good fortune, rather than jaded. That way, their joy could be extended by the man, rather than limited by it. However, as I’m sure you know, trying to convince someone to change for the sake of others is rather difficult.

# The Selfish Solution
----------------------

But what if being happy for others could be done completely selfishly? In life, it’s rare to find things that are good or can make you happy. It’s much easier to find things that can make your life harder or even kill you. The world is full of entropy - the tendency for things to fall apart. Constant work is needed to restore and maintain the good things that come about. To suffer because of the good fortune of those around you is a tragedy. It is much better to just share in and amplify their happiness. That way, their happiness can rub off on you too.

Furthermore, deciding to be happy for your friends can lead to making even more friends. People celebrate good fortune by hosting events with their friends. If you’re fun to be around when they’re happy, you’ll probably be invited to these celebrations. You’ll be able to meet a lot of people who are also fun to tell good news to. You might make friends who will be happy for you when you succeed, amplifying the few good moments that come along in life. And in turn, they’ll share their good fortune with you, increasing the amount of good moments that come along in your life. Together you can help make each of your lives a lot more bearable.

# Seeing the Light
------------------

Being happy for others wouldn’t just benefit the people around the miserable man. Being happy for others can also make the miserable man just a man. When he stops seeing the improvement of others’ lives as a curse, he is able to appreciate the blessing of the world becoming a slightly better place. And it is in that appreciation where happiness can spring. For it is in cherishing the oases in the desert of life that we can continue on our long and difficult journey with purpose. And this can be our dowsing rod to find more of these sanctuaries in the storm. That is the beauty of being Happy For Others
