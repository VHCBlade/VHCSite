Flutter is awesome! It's remarkably easy to learn, since all of the code is in a single modern language (Google's Dart). No more dealing with Markup Languages that require copy pasting a lot of code or cryptic CSS Files. Of course the greatest selling point of Flutter is that it can be deployed pretty much anywhere while reusing all your code. And it does all of this while maintaining a consistent beauty with lightning fast rendering times. It started with iOS and Android and now you can deploy Flutter anywhere. Even on a website, just like this one!
