Provider to the rescue! Provider gives us a way to avoid this trap. If you aren't yet familiar with Provider, I suggest clicking on the link to their package site and reading the documentation and example. You can also easily find some resources about Provider made by other people with just a quick Google Search. Some even come from the Google Team! Combining related information to form one state under a ChangeNotifier strikes the perfect balance between individual states and developer usability. Provider gives us a good baseline from which our state management solution can spring.
