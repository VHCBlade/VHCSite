While Provider is good, there are some things about it that I take issue with. 

First, ChangeNotifier, the class suggested to hold our Model, has a dependency on the Flutter Framework! While this isn't a big issue, it just feels disgusting. This is also makes it impossible to have our model be purely dart code.

Second, there isn't a canonical way to have a ChangeNotifier that relies on a Parent ChangeNotifier get an update from the Parent. This can lead to some confusion within large teams about what the right way to update children is. 

Third, it requires our buttons and other low level UI to have a dependency on the Model. This leads to a lot boilerplate code being repeated and makes it more difficult to make changes to our code.

Luckily, Provider is powerful enough that we can easily fix this with a few lines of code.
